                <h2><span class="highlight-2">Introduction</span></h2>
                <p> In this project, I developed a cake shopping interface in React, and learned to use various React tools such as class components, stateless components, and hooks.</p>
                <p> The final product is the website of an online cake shop display, where users can browse through a list of cakes, filter items by categories,  sort the items on display, and add or remove any number of item to a shopping cart. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2><span class="highlight-3">Design</span></h2>
                <p> Many design and usability principles were considered throughout the creation of this interface:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The filters, as well as the total price of items in the cart, are fixed at the top of the page for visibility and accessibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Labels are in a smaller font underneath the title in order to  convey information hierarchy, 
                        and are highlighted according to their categories for visual indications of different categorizations. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Item cards in the cart are smaller and contain less information to reduce unnecessary clutter, but are styled similarly to item cards the “Browse” section provide consistency
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2><span class="highlight-4">React App</span></h2>
